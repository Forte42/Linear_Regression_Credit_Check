# Linear_Regression_Credit_Check

In this notebook, I use machine learning techniques to train and evaluate models with imbalanced classes. I use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

## Technologies

This code was written on Windows 11 running python 3.7.13. It also uses Pandas (Version 1.3.5), and Scikit_learn (Version 1.0.2).

---

## Installation Guide

Both Pandas and Scikit_learn can be installed with pip install.

---

## Usage

This notebook was made to investigate using oversampled models. I compare an impbalanced model with and without oversampling.
